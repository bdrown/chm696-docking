# Docking activities in CHM696

CHM696 - Chemical Biology is a graduate-level chemistry course taught at Purdue University focused on the concepts and techniques used by chemical biologists. Small-molecule/protein interactions are of particular interest, so computational approaches to predict effective ligand binding can be powerful tools to guide experimentation. For the final problem set of the course, students will conduct ligand docking and virtual screening to identify new leads.

## Docking tutorial

Usage of Dock 6.11 is introduced in a model system: the complex of EGFR with gefitinib.

Visit the [tutorial](01_docking_tutorial.md) for more information about how to get started.

## Docking assignment

For Problem Set 6, students will complete a virtual screen of using ligand docking. Details can be found in the [assignment description](02_docking_assignment.md).

## Requirements

These activities are intended to be conducted on the [Scholar compute cluster](https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/compute/scholar) maintained by RCAC but can be accomplished on similarly configured systems with the following:

- Compiled binaries of [Dock 6.11](https://dock.compbio.ucsf.edu/DOCK_6/)
- [Chimera](https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/download.html) or [ChimeraX](https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimerax/)
- Workload manager like [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html)

## Issues?

If you encounter problems with instructions or shell scripts, submit an [Issue](https://github.com/bdrown/chm696-docking/issues). If you are a CHM696 student, please contact Prof. Drown via email.
